    "### Form of regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-task learning works because regularization induced by requiring an algorithm to perform well on a related task can be superior to regularization that prevents overfitting by penalizing all complexity uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced Training Time \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to train many different models for each task we are able to train one model for all tasks.\n",

    "## Problems with MTL\n",
    "\n",
    "### negative transfer \n",
    "\n",
    "### dominating tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### more complicated loss function\n",
    "\n",
